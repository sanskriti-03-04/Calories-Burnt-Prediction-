A Machine Learning-based model to predict the number of calories burnt during physical activities. We are using the parameters such as the duration of the exercise that is performed , what is the average heart beats per minute , the body temperature , along with the height and weight of the person. This will predict the amount of calories the person will be burning.

Overview
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the number of calories burnt based on various physical activity parameters. The goal is to provide an accurate and reliable model for fitness enthusiasts and professionals.

Features
- Predicts calories burnt based on activity type, duration, intensity, and user characteristics
- Uses XGBRegressor , sklearn , metrics
- Trained on a dataset of https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fmendes/fmendesdat263xdemos
- Achieves an accuracy of  1.4833678883314132
